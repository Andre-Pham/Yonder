// Strings that take in parameters should be marked with an "XParam" suffix.
// Example: "car.description1Param" = "The car has %@ wheels";
// Params should be avoided unless deemed absolutely necessary.
// Numbers should be displayed using `YonderNumeral` and related, rather than be embedded into a string.

// MARK: - Main

"gameName" = "Yonder";

// MARK: - Main Menu

"mainMenu.newGame" = "New Game";
"mainMenu.resumeGame" = "Resume Game";
