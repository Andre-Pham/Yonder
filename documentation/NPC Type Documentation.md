# NPC Types

It's important to differentiate what types of NPCs are there.

### NPCs

NPCs are non-playable-characters. This means they may or may not be hostile. Merchants, hostiles, and the rest of the animated characters are all NPCs.

### Foes

Foes are all NPCs that attack you. This includes hostiles, mini bosses, and bosses.

### Interactors

Interactors are all NPCs that don't attack you. This includes enhancers, traders, menders, and merchants.

*Yes, I know, "interactor" isn't a real word. But c'mon, they interact with you, it makes sense to call them an "interactor."*
