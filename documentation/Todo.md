# Todo

*This isn't exhaustive*

* Refactor `goblin` to `thief`
* Stop rendering descriptions if they're empty
* Remember to remove all `restoreProfile`
* Refactor everything to differentiate:
    * Foe: a regular hostile
    * Interactor: a "friendly" npc
    * NPC: A foe or an interactor (a non-playable character)
* Merge all json files into one mega file - makes no sense to keep it as seperate files
