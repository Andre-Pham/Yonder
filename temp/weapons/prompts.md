You are my fellow rpg game designer. You are going to help me create content for my game. We are going to be creating some weapons for my rpg game. First you must understand a few things.

Every weapon has a "weaponProfileTag" (weapon profile tag). This is the full list of available options:

1. damage: the weapon deals damage
2. damageAndRestoration: the weapon deals damage and restores health
3. restoration: the weapon heals you, first restoring health, then any excess heals armor points
4. healthRestoration: the weapon heals your health
5. armorPointsRestoration: the weapon heals your shields
6. collateral: the weapon has some "chaotic" effect that often (but not necessarily) damages you, such as weapons that damage both you and the opponent, weapons that convert your own health into shields, weapons that have burning effects, etc.
7. consumesFoe: the weapon has some "stealing" effect such as taking or copying the opponent's attack, or weapons that restore a portion of damage dealt as health.

Every weapon also has a "regionProfileTag" (region profile tag). This will be discussed later, but essentially it's the area the weapon is found, such a forest, or desert, or dungeon.

Here are some examples of weapons I expect. It's in JSON format.

```
{
    "weaponName": "Vineblade",
    "weaponProfileTag": "damage",
    "regionProfileTag": "forest",
    "description": "A slender sword adorned with intricate vines that seem to pulse with the essence of the forest. Its blade, sharp as thorns, slices through the air with remarkable agility."
},
{
    "weaponName": "Thornwhip",
    "weaponProfileTag": "damageAndRestoration",
    "regionProfileTag": "forest",
    "description": "A whip woven from resilient vines, its thorny tendrils lash out at foes, inflicting both pain and offering a restorative touch. It harnesses the life force of the forest, mending wounds with each strike."
},
{
    "weaponName": "Fernweaver Staff",
    "weaponProfileTag": "restoration",
    "regionProfileTag": "forest",
    "description": "A staff crowned with delicate fern leaves that shimmer with soothing energy. When wielded, it channels the vitality of the forest, mending wounds and replenishing the essence of life."
},
{
    "weaponName": "Oakheart Shield",
    "weaponProfileTag": "armorPointsRestoration",
    "regionProfileTag": "forest",
    "description": "A sturdy shield carved from the mighty heartwood of an ancient oak. It grants unparalleled protection, reinforcing armor and restoring its durability with an unyielding bond to the forest's strength."
},
```

Despite being called weapons, these can be a range of different items, including weapons like swords and shields, and magical items like tomes and staffs, and more. Use your imagination! The only exception is armor and clothing you'd wear.

Does this all make sense?





Great. Before we start, I have some rules I want you to follow. First, each description must be at most one sentence. No more than one! It should be kept relatively brief. Two, each description should be almost entirely visual. If you had a weapon called "Stalactite Lance", a perfect description would be "A long, pointed spear fashioned from a razor-sharp stalactite". Understood?





Let's start with cavern weapons. These are weapons that exist in both shallow and deep underground caverns. We're going to do each weaponProfileTag. Let's start with damage. Please create 10 of these in the provided JSON format I previously gave.

> Let's start with Songhai Empire weapons. These are based off the Songhai Empire faction from the Duelyst game. We're going to do each weaponProfileTag. Let's start with damage. Please create 10 of these in the provided JSON format I previously gave.





Continuing on, now let's do damageAndRestoration. We'll do 5 of these. Make sure the names make sense for damage AND restoration, and communicates that the weapon can do both. Despite these being called weapons, they don't have to be traditional weapons - any item that could do damage and heal is acceptable. For these weapons, try to avoid traditionally dangerous weapons that "hurt".





Continuing on, now let's do restoration. We'll do 5 of these.





Continuing on, now let's do armorPointsRestoration. We'll do 5 of these. Don't include any protective armor or clothing in these.





Let's do both collateral and consumesFoe. We'll do 3 of each. Be creative with these ones.





Finally, let's finish off with healthRestoration. We'll do 5 of these. These can have a divine holy theme if appropriate. Make sure to not base any of them off traditionally damaging weapons. These should be comprised solely of amulets, staffs, tomes, sceptres, charms, runes, and unique ideas like pixie dust, "emerald grace", and stuff like that. Don't use pixie dust and "emerald grace" directly, though, I've already added those.
