# Important

This directory tracks the categorisation and metadata creation for all enemy/NPC assets. The code written here isn't long term - they're single use scripts, and hence the quality should be judged as such. After this process is completed and the assets are imported into the game this directory will be removed.

(What I'm saying is any code written here was scrapped together and is not in the slightest clean nor maintainable and made to be deleted after their job is performed)
